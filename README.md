### Inspiration for CONSERVE

The idea for CONSERVE emerged from our experience in a sustainability and carbon footprint course. As students with a technological background, we wanted to use our skills to positively impact the world. During our research, we discovered that existing apps and websites for tracking carbon footprints were often complex and difficult to use daily. This insight led to the creation of CONSERVEâ€”a user-friendly app designed to help people progressively reduce their carbon emissions day by day, month by month, and year by year.

### Objective of CONSERVE

To encourage the users of CONSERVE to make environmentally consicious choices based on their carbon emission.

### Functionality of CONSERVE

**Daily Interaction and Tracking:**
- CONSERVE sends daily notifications (morning, afternoon, or night) prompting users to answer questions about their daily activities.
- The questions cover transportation used for commuting, food consumption, and plastic waste generated.
- Based on the responses, CONSERVE calculates the user's carbon emissions and informs them if they've reached their limit, encouraging environmentally conscious choices like reducing food consumption or opting for public transportation.

**User Flow in CONSERVE:**

1. **Splash Screen & Authentication:**
   - Users are greeted with a splash screen upon opening the app.
   - If not logged in, users are directed to the sign-in/sign-up page for authentication and account creation.

2. **Home Page:**
   - Post-login, users land on the home page displaying their daily, weekly, and monthly records.
   - Users can view detailed stats and numbers by tapping on each record button (daily, weekly, monthly).

3. **Profile Management:**
   - Users can update their profile information, such as profile picture and name.
   - The profile page also shows current streaks, account age, and highest streaks.

4. **Daily Surveys:**
   - Users are prompted to complete daily surveys if not already done.
   - The survey page allows users to take morning, afternoon, and night surveys focused on transportation, food, and recycling.

5. **Insights & Achievements:**
   - The insights tab leads to a page displaying achievements in terms of badges and tree progress.
